# Finding your product niche

Now it's time to find what products you want to start creating exactly. In order to find clients, you will need to learn a specific skill to find clients. For reference, I used to create Discord Bots, Minecraft Plugins and generic APIs. I also spent quite some time working for clients in the web3 market, but that's out of scope for this book.

## What we are going to do

Of course it's not going to be enough to just find a niche, you obviously also have to learn to create those types of products. So, the steps are as follows:

1. Find a Niche
2. Figure out what you need to learn
3. Create 2 basic projects to show case that skill
