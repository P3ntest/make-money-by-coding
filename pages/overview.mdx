# Overview

![Overview Husky](/assets/huskies/overview.png)

Alright, enough talking about boring introductory stuff. Let's actually make some money huh? But how do we even do that? Well lets start by getting an overview of what you're gonna do.

## Steps to your first bucks

### 1. Learn the basics of coding

First you will have to learn to actually write code. Don't worry, I will tell you exactly which language and how much you need to learn. You don't need to be a pro, just enough to make some basic projects.

Now if I'm being honest, just knowing how to code a calculator or a to-do list won't get you very far. But, like with everything in life, the more advanced you get, the more time you'll have to put in to get to the next level. To get around this problem, I will teach you **exactly** the few advanced topics you need to know to make money. This way you can get to the next level without spending years learning.

### 2. Find a rough idea of what type of projects you want to sell

Now you'll need to find a "niche". I will give you a few ideas and categories I recommend you choose from. However you can choose any other category you like, if your willing to put in the effort to learn it.

By niche I don't mean a specific problem or project, but a type of projects. So don't worry, these are not markets that can get saturated.

### 3. Learn how to make those projects

Now you will have to learn how to make the projects you chose. I will provide you with a few resources to learn from. You can also use any other resources you like. I will teach you how to learn any coding topic you want to learn.

### 4. Make a few projects to demonstrate your skills

Now it's time to start creating some real projects! For me this is always the most fun part. You get to get creative and build anything you like. No matter how useless or stupid it is, as long as it shows your skills. And the best part is, your not even wasting your time and other people will actually look at your shit!

### 5. Make a portfolio to showcase your projects

Now you can get even more creative! I will teach you how to create impressive and stunning portfolio websites to show off all (literally all, you don't know anything else) of the amazing things you learned so far. You will need this for the next step and also to convince clients to pay you money even though you have virtually no experience.

### 6. Apply at various freelancing websites and forums

> You wont find chickens if your not on a farm. ~Me, just now

Alright, let's get you that freelancer title. I will give you a list of platforms and also a guide on how to find them.

Then I will teach how how to rock your application and get accepted.

### 7. Find your first client

Now it's getting **really** exciting huh? Your gonna meet the ~love of yo~ - _cough_ - first person to pay you very soon.

This will include some luck and patience. You can use this time to sharpen your skills and improve your portfolio. Your job is to find a client that needs a project you can make - and then to fulfill it for a ridiculously low price, or even for free. Your hourly rate at this point will be lower than a McDonald's employee. But trust me, it's worth it. You will ask for reviews and testimonials from your client. This will be your first step to building a reputation. Reputation is everything in the freelancing world.

### 8. Fulfill the client's requirements

Now it's time to actually make the project. You will have to communicate with the client and make sure you understand what they want. Then you will have to make the project and deliver it to them. You will also have to make sure they are satisfied with the project. If they are not, you will have to make changes until they are.

This won't be easy.

### 9. Get paid

PAYDAY! You will have to make sure you get paid. I will teach you different ways to receive money and have it end up in your bank account.

### How to proceed from here?

After you have made your first bucks, you will obviously want to make more and actually get paid more than those people in touristy areas that paint themselves silver and pretend to be statues. I will give you some tips and a few pitfalls to avoid.
