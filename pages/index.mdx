# Introduction

Hey, glad your here!

## What is this?

This is an **Interactive E-Book** I wrote to help you earn your first bucks online. I will guide you through every step of the way, all the way from writing your first line of code all the way to receiving your first paycheck.

## Who is this for?

This book is for anyone who wants to earn money online. Whether you are a student, a stay-at-home parent, or a professional looking to earn some extra cash, this book is for you.

## Why did I write this?

Let's face it. There is **A LOT** of advice out there on how to make money online. Everyone is trying to sell you their stupid course or trying to convince you, that they are giving you something for free. Everyone is claiming to know some secret that will make you rich overnight.

And let's be honest, <u>**most of it is bullshit.**</u>

Most of them also assume that you are stupid and completely incompetent of learning any real skills. Even if one of them actually works, do you think it would make you happy? Being a _professional Dropshipper_? Like wtf even is that? Imagine your grandkids asking you what you did for a living and you start going on about how you sold cheap chinese products to people who didn't need them. That's just sad.

Another big reason why none of these courses can work, is because that market is **super saturated**. Everyone even remotely interested in starting a business is getting these ads shoved down their throats.

### How is this different?

Let me give you bulletproof bullet points: (pun intended)

1. **Im not selling you anything.** This book is completely free. Seriously. I don't want your money. I want you to succeed. Why? Because I need somewhere to put my spare time besides working on things that actually make me money and I looked for a creative outlet. I also have a few friends who could really benefit from this.
2. **Real Skill**: Coding and software development is a real skill that is in high demand. Not only will it help you to earn your first bucks but it has high potential for you to land a high paying job. Yes, even with ChatGPT and other AI tools, there is still a high demand for software developers.
3. **No Bullshit**: I not gonna start teaching you unnecessary things that you don't need. I will teach you exactly what you need to earn money. Not more, not less.
4. **From start to finish**: I assume that you know nothing. My goal is to guide you to your first paycheck, without you having to ever wonder what to do next.
5. **No Abstractions**: I will tell you **exactly** what to do. I will not tell you to "build a website" and then leave you hanging. I will tell you exactly how to build a website. I will also exactly tell you how to get your first client, how to actually receive your money, where to go if you need help, etc.
6. **Zero cost**: All you need for this is access to a computer and an internet connection and some time. That's it, seriously.
7. **No ChatGPT**: The modern internet is full of mindless AI generated content. This isn't. This is me. I love huskies.

## Who is this from?

Hi, I'm Julius.

I am a software engineer who has been writing software since the age of 5. I earned my first paycheck online when I was 16. I worked as an online freelancer for 2 years before I started my own software company [Confly](https://confly.dev). After Confly failed to take off, I started working as a CTO for [meinGPT](https://meingpt.com), a company that brings AI to german companies.
