# Setting up Git and GitHub

This page is currently a stub.

Using Git with GitHub is not crucial but highly recommended.

It's basically like a Google Drive folder for code with a bunch of cool features.

Just know this exists and you might have to / want to learn it.

Your GitHub Profile could also be used as your portfolio.
