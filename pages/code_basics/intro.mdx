# Let's talk JavaScript

Let's start by looking at the official definition of JavaScript as per [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript):

> JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

Did you just throw up because it felt like a nerd puked on you? Don't worry, I got you covered. Let's break it down and only focus on the important parts. Let me first rephrase the definition in a more human-friendly way, ignoring the boring parts:

> JavaScript is a **programming language** that is used to make **web** pages interactive. It can also be used to build **other types of software** (Anything you like, bascially!). JavaScript is very **versatile** and allows you to write code in different styles.

Okay, that's better.

Now let's talk about what JavaScript fundamentally is, and for that, a bit of history is needed. (Don't worry, I'll keep it short, I hate history too).

Back in the years before I was born, the internet was being created. At first, there where only static web pages, meaning that the content was just static and couldn't move, nor could you interact with it (Just as boring as reading a book!). The only thing you had were interactive links that would take you to another page, which again, was boring.

So now there was a need for some sort of way to allow the creators of web pages to make them more interactive. But you can't just allow the creators of websites to run any code they like on your computer, right? That would be a security nightmare! Imagine going to a website and it just starts deleting all your files. That would be a disaster! So a programming language with the following (roughly) two properties was needed:

1. It had to be safe. Traditional programming languages (like C, C++, Java, etc.) get converted (or _compiled_ in nerdspeak) into machine code (you know, those 1s and 0s) and then run directly by your computer. This is dangerous because the code can do anything it wants. So the language had to be designed in a way that it can't do anything harmful to your computer. The solution was to make it _interpreted_, meaning that the code is not run directly by your computer, but by another program that checks if the code is safe before running it. This way, the code can't do anything harmful to your computer. So unlinke traditional programming languages, JavaScript doesn't get converted into machine code, instead, the code you write will be directly sent to the browser, which will then run it for you (and making sure it doesn't harm anyting). You can imagine it almost like someone reading the recipe you wrote for a cake step by step insteand of you just baking the cake yourself and giving it to them.

2. You had to be able to use it to interact with the web page. This means that you should be able to change the content of the page, move things around, etc. This is the reason why JavaScript is so closely associated with web development. It nativly support a bunch of things for web development, like interacting with the page, certain networking capabilities and build in support for JSON, which is a data format that is widely used in web development, but more on that later.

## First taste of JavaScript

Here is a simple example of some JavaScript code:

```javascript copy
var name = prompt("What is your name?");
alert("Hello, " + name + "!");
```

Wan't to see a magic trick? Well I told you that JavaScript runs on web pages via the browser. Well guess what? This is a web page and you are using a browser! So let's run the code above right here in this page! Most browsers have a built-in tool called the _console_ that allows you to run your own JavaScript Code on any page. You can open it by pressing `F12` on your keyboard and then selecting the `Console` tab. If you are using a Mac, you can open it by pressing `Cmd + Option + J`. If you are using a different browser, you can just google how to open the console for your browser. Once you have the console open, you can just copy and paste the code above into the console and press `Enter`.
