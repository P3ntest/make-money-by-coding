Now it's time to learn backend development.

## What is backend development?

Things that don't run in the browser.

## This task

The steps for completing this are the same as with the frontend part.

The problem however is, that backend only applications can be quite boring. So I had quite some trouble coming up with ideas:

- A software that grabs the current price of some stock (/ weather at a certain location / gas prices / etc.) and sends you a notification via a discord webhook.
- A simple meme generator API
- An API returning a random, generated husky with its name, age, fur pattern, eye color, favorite toy and email address
- An API that thinks of a random number between 1 and 100 and you can guess via a GET request if the number is higher or lower than your guess. If you guess right, you get a link to a rickroll video.
