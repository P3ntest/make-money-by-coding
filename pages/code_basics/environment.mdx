# Setting up your environment

In this section we will set up what you need to start developing software.

## What will I need to set up?

Wait Julius, I thought you said JavaScript runs in my browser? Why do I need to set up anything?

Well, it's not that easy. You will need software to write your code in and things like version control which will help you keep track of your code.

There is also another thing I haven't mentioned until now. JavaScript can run anywhere, not just in your browser. Thanks to this thing called Node.js, you can run JavaScript outside of your browser, like on your computer or some server. For those familiar with other programming languages like Python or Java, Node.js basically allows you to use JavaScript like you would use those languages.

But why?

There are lots of reasons why you would want to run JavaScript outside of your browser. For example, you can just code anything you would code with another language in JS, because JS is awesome. You could for example (lots of people do this) write your http server in JS. In case your wondering, an http server is what runs in the background of a website. It's what sends you the website when you type in the URL into your browser and also handles things like authentication and communication with a database.

Another use case for JS on the server is for so called "headless" applications. These are applications that don't have a direct user interface (in the form of a website or GUI) but still play an important role. Say for example you write a chatbot for a platform like Discord or WhatsApp. When someone sends a message to the chatbot, it will respond need to respond to it. This is done by running a server in the background that listens for messages and responds to them. This server could be written in JS.

Okay let's recap. JavaScript can be either run in your browser or directly on a server. When running it in the browser, it's responsible for making websites interactive. When running it on a server, it can do many things, like running an http server or a chatbot. To run JavaScript on a server, you need Node.js. To run JavaScript in your browser, you don't need anything, since all browsers come with support for directly running JavaScript built in.

## Things we will set up

1. [**VSCode**: A code editor. This is where you will write your code.](./environment/vscode)
2. [**Git and GitHub**: A version control system. This is what you will use to keep track of your code.](./environment/git)
3. [**Node.js**: This is what allows you to run JavaScript on your computer.](./environment/nodejs)
