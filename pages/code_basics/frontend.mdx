The next step is to learn how to use JavaScript to create a frontend application.

From here on I will stop guiding you through every single micro step, as you will have to start thinking for yourself at some point. I will still guide you through the important parts, but I will not hold your hand through every single line of code. If you wan't to be a software developer, you will have to learn how to think for yourself.

**HOWEVER:** If any software developer tells you that they know everything and never have to look anything up, they are lying. The most important skill a software developer can have is the ability to look things up. So don't be afraid to google things. And even better, we have ChatGPT now. So if you have a question, just ask it! And trust me, even the best of the best sometimes forget how to do the most basic things.

## Steps to complete this step:

1. Find an idea for a frontend application. Suitable ideas: Todo List, Weather App, Calculator, A stupid game involving only buttons, A cookie clicker but with huskies, etc.

2. Google "How to create a &lt;your idea&gt; in JavaScript". You will find a bunch of tutorials on how to create your idea. You can also ask ChatGPT for help.

3. Make sure you understand every line of code you write. If you don't understand something, ask ChatGPT to explain it to you.

4. Find a small feature you want to build that goes beyond the tutorial you used. This could be a feature that the tutorial didn't cover, or a feature that you want to add to your application. Try to implement this feature until you understand you make it on your own (= without the tutorial, with chatgpt and google).

5. Show this to at least 3 friends / family members and ask them to use it. Ask them for feedback. Trust me, this step is crucial.
