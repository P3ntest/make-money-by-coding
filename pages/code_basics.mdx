Alright, let's get started.

## What you'll learn

I'll teach you how to code in JavaScript. JavaScript, - or JS for short - is not only my absolute favorite programming language, but also the one I hate the most. Don't worry, you'll learn to hate it too.

### No but fr, why JavaScript?

Look at this chart, it shows the most used programming languages according to the Stack Overflow survey in 2023. If you didn't know, StackOverflow is by far the most popular website for developers to ask and answer questions. So this survey is a pretty good indicator of what languages are popular in the industry.

And as a funny coincidence, you will also be learning some HTML and CSS. These are the languages that are used to create websites. You will need to know them to create your portfolio and they are super handy to know in general.

### Why not python?

I hate it. Next question.

### Additional technologies you will learn
