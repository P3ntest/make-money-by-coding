# Finding your actual Niche

I see two ways for you to find your first niche to start selling products.

1. Take one of mine and trust that they are still valuable
2. Go to marketplaces and see where the money is at

## My ideas

I am going to dump a bunch of niches that either I used to do, or I saw demand for

### Discord Bots

This is by far the one I spend the most time on. Here's what you'll use to create them:

- Discord.JS for NodeJS
- That's it

Just search on YouTube or Google (if that's your style) for a tutorial, it's quite easy.

### Minecraft Plugins

This one gives slightly less money in my experience, but if you love the game it is definetly worth it, because it'll be a lot of fun. (Trust me)

**WARNING:** You will have to learn Java on top of JavaScript, which is a different language.

### Landing Pages

If your a bit more creative and can design beautiful landing pages, this is the one for you. You'll have to learn (or have the talent) to first design them and then learn how to translate them into code. For the coding part I recommend learning HTML 5 and Tailwind CSS.
